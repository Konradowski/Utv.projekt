---------------------------General Description--------------------------------
There is a total of five sensors connected to the raspberry pi, this
includes two current sensors (ACS712) for current measurement and
two ADCs (Analog-Digital Converter, ADS1115).
Both current sensors is connected to the ADC via a specific pins, see
schematics below.

In order to measure the voltage a single wire is connected between the
ADC and a specific location on the physical circuitboard on the
demonstrator, there is a total of two pins dedicated for voltage
measurements.

Too see the schematics, press the button below!
------------------------------How to use---------------------------------------
[Start/Pause Sensor]: Start the current and voltage measurements or
pause the current and voltage measurements.

[Resistive load start/stop]: Send a control signal to the Resistive load on
the demonstrator, press again to turn off.

[Inductive load start/stop]: Send a control signal to the Inductive load on
the demonstrator, press again to turn off.

[Capacitive load start/stop]: Send a control signal to the Capacitive load
on the demonstrator, press again to turn off.

--------------------------Project Description-----------------------------------
This project is a part of the course Utvecklingsprojekt at Halmstad University.
The goal of the project is to simulate the swedish power grid in a small scale,
and show how different components in the systems works together. This project
will try to provive understanding in how the swedish powersystem works.
This demonstrator could also we used in educational purposes by teachers
and students.
